# Project 0

This project is meant to fulfil all the requirements for Project0.
The directions stated the website could be about any topic, and so I chose the Persona game Series
In the homepage.scss file, you'll find that I have used classes, Ids, inheritance, @media, and nesting.
The rest of the sass files are relatively similar and are meant to slightly change up the elements in each webpage, while still staying responsive to phones.
In index.html, you'll find that I have used bootstrap and its column system to optimize the view for smaller screens and using one of bootstraps built in alerts.
the other .html files fulfil the criteria for minimum amount of webpages, all of which link to each other, use tables, images, hyperlinks, and classes
